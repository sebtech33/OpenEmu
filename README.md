# Note!
[WIP, this is a small test with a big undertaking and its in early development]

# OpenEmu
OpenEmu is a way to preconfigure many emulators and make it easy for the enduser to setup. This is ment to be run as a script in the terminal and will feature a GUI in the terminal eventually.

# Where is it?
There is no software at the moment, i just created the repository to have it available for when i will start uploading files.
