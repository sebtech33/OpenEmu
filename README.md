# Note!
[WIP, this is a small test with a big undertaking and its in early development]

# OpenEmu
OpenEmu is a way to preconfigure many emulators and make it easy for the enduser to setup. This is ment to be run as a script in the terminal and will feature a GUI in the terminal eventually.

# Name
I have chosen the name OpenEmu, you know Open Emulation or Emulation for anyone.

# What does it do?

## Now
As of now I have locally made a version in PowerShell that gets information on two emulators and where to get them. Further I'm able to download the latest version or specify a specific version using the API. No further implementation is made yet. When there is a useable GUI and more is implemented I will release the it. 

## What I want it to do / Goals I want to achieve
- [x] Download any emulator and be able to specify version
- [ ] Easily set up each emulator to work on any hardware with optimalizations for each hardware type (Handheld, Low/Medium/High end PC and so on) and add extra features outside of emulators like mods for games or sharders and so on. NOT GUARANTEED
- [ ] Be able to reinstall emulator and be able to reload the configuration if someting is acting up.
- [ ] Be able to add emulation games through Steam or EmulationStation/Pegasus, maybe with the use of ![SRM](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager) as this will add pictures and metadata from ![SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/)
- [ ] Add/Remove shortcuts from the start menu
- [ ] Be able to use it portable as in with a portable SSD or something of that kind (As of now i just want the software to be portable since it will be easier for everyone to use as you just run the file and the menu will show up)

# What I need to add to this repo
- [ ] Software */Duh/*
- [ ] Install instructions
- [ ] Usage instructions
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Ways to contribute (This is strictly to help me out with code or financially support me, but not nessecary to use the software)

# Ok great, where can i get it?
There is no software at the moment, i just created the repository to have it available for when i will start uploading files.

# End
If you found this ahead of release, thank you for reading and I would appreciate any suggestions or feature requests to the list above. If you want to contribute to the code I have made please do make a pull request.
